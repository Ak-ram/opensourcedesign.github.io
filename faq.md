If you have questions relating to Open Source Design that **are not mentioned 
below** please [open an issue](https://github.com/opensourcedesign/organization/issues).

### Do You Care About Free Software

Absolutely. Free software is incredibly important to many of founders and core 
contributors and founders of OSD and many of us use only free software daily.
Many of us have dedicated our lives to working exclusively on free software.
While we are aware of the definitions of ["open source" and "free
software"](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html),
Open Source Design as a community, is not assigning a political stance to our 
word choice and it's inherant semantic debate as per the Free Software Foundation
asks people to "choose a side". That said, many of us agree with the FSF's 
principles.

### Why "Open Source" not "Free Software"

Our name choice was never an intentional decision or discussion. In our earliest
organizing we just started intuitively *using* our name (Open Source Design) and
it stuck. The reasons we feel good about this choice are:

1. The Free as in beer / freedom confusion
2. Free software is older and has a specific community, culture, and goals
3. Open source is a newer term and (can) have broader goals
4. Acronyms (FOSS, FLOSS) are not user friendly
5. Spelling out said acronyms is also not designer / user friendly
6. Open source has done a better job at outreach and has broader public understanding
7. Open source as a concept extends beyond software yet can overlap with design
