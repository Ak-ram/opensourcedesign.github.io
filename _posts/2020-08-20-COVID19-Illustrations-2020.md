Based on [recommendations from The World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019)  and others, you’ll find symbols to communicate good hygiene and social distancing. While we can’t be like front line brave medical professionals across the globe, we hope these icons/illustrations aid in communicating some of the most important things people can do to protect themselves and their communities.


####Free COVID-19 Awareness Icons

All solid COVID-19 illustrations are available [Open Source](https://app.biorender.com/). A trial for some period to incorporate these can be availed at [bioRENDER](https://app.biorender.com/).
