# "Free & Usable" feedback

The slideshow titled **"Free & Usable"** was created by [@bvnk](https://brennannovak.com) as per his experiences working on FOSS project [Mailpile](https://mailpile.is) from during 2013 to 2015. This is a "working draft" of a concept that has been discussed with [@jancborchardt[(http://jancborchardt.net) and others.

This is being published as a work-in-progress so as to sollicite feedback, ideas, and improvements. The reason for doing this openly is to establish a process that is open, iterative, and collaborative regarding structure of the organization itself. Let's weave the practices of open source software into our companies as well as our code.

### Notes from @dkg
  
- [ ] Add slides about open source developers desiring designers to join
- [ ] Agreement with developers on given projects to work with designers
- [ ] Potential funding for existing developers on a given project
- [ ] Sometimes a bug is contingent on low-level engineering change
- [ ] Plan for "emergent" challenges and un-expected engineering complexity

### Notes from @jancborchardt

- [ ] First off: use a proper typeface ;) Open Sans or Source Sans
- [ ] I’m not sure about slide 14, about the money, I don’t think money "pollutes" FOSS, it allows people to work full-time on it. I haven’t really seen the »It attracts the wrong type of contributors case« in the wild. Do you have examples of that?
- [ ] To the »Successful FOSS projects with biz models« you can add GitLab and ownCloud ;)
- [ ] I’d cut slide 17 in favor of just slide 18
- [ ] The Mailpile logo seems a bit off in there? As it’s more of a general approach
- [ ] Slide 20 is a repetition of 18 –> replace 18 with the with-arrows version and get rid of 20.
- [ ] there are 2 different »Issue Wrangling« slides
- [ ] Slide 25 - is that actually a scale with x and y axis? Might be better as a list

### Notes from @gusandrews

- [ ] Get feedback from FOSS community how they relate to funding & scaling
- [ ] Better explain difference between "crowdfunding" and "end users" the later meaning "selling" software
