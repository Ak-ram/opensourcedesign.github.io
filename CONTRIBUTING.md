Welcome to Open Source Design
=============================

There are different ways to contribute to Open Source Design (OSD). How to best
contribute will depend upon your skill set. However, it is important to
determine if you want to *contribute* to the OSD project itself and/or our
community, or if you want to contribute design related resources, job offers,
events.

## General Design

...

## Web Design

For now it is best to [browse the
issues](https://github.com/opensourcedesign/opensourcedesign.github.io/issues)
and find things that relate to design.


## Documentation

## Web Development

This step requires that you have Jekyll installed and working on your machine,
as well as baseline knowledge of how to work with it.

1. Fork and clone the main website repository

```
git clone git@github.com:your-github/opensourcedesign.github.io
```

2. Run our installer script

```
scripts/install.sh 
```

This step should pull down all of the repositories that consitute the OSD
website. This script is a work-in-progress and is meant to just make things
easier for now. 

*Currently, it most helpful for people who "have push access" to the main OSD 
repos. Eventually, this should take into account a user forking all of the
repos.*
