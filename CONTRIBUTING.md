Welcome to Open Source Design
=============================

There are different ways to contribute to Open Source Design (OSD). How to best
contribute will depend upon your skill set. However, it is important to
determine if you want to *contribute* to the OSD project itself and/or our
community, or if you want to contribute design related resources, job offers,
events.
